# Infinite Scroll React Component
This infinite scroll react component seamlessly scrolls its members while we are able to provide next members in the queue, this makes infinite scroll possible.
The `InfiniteScroll` component is optimized for 2 main things:
- Performance
  - Only visible members are rendered + 2 members on each side ready to be scrolled in view
- User Experience
  - The user is able to grab memebers and freely slide them left or right (no flicker, no jump, no pagination buttons, althoug the code can be easily adjusted for those purposes as well)
